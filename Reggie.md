# Reggie the Fox scarf
This patten should, in theory, make a Fox scarf.  I've only done this pattern once (crocheting and making at the same time) so there might be mistakes. 

Pull requests to correct mistakes greatly appreciated.


You may use this pattern without charge, but you may not sell the pattern or use it to make a product which you sell.


I made this using aran weight cotton yarn with a 4mm hook.  It would work really nicely with chunky yarn and a 5mm hook.  
Remember to choose a hook small enough to make the head without there being too many gaps as it will be lightly stuffed.


## Materials

- brown (foxy) colour (~250m) 
- White < 20m

Safety eyes (but you could use stitching or buttons)
