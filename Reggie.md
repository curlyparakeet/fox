# Reggie the Fox scarf
This patten should, in theory, make a Fox scarf.  I've only done this pattern once (crocheting and making at the same time) so there ~~might~~ will be mistakes. 

Pull requests to correct mistakes greatly appreciated.


You may use this pattern without charge, but you may not sell the pattern or use it to make a product which you sell.


I made this using aran weight cotton yarn with a 4mm hook.  It would work really nicely with chunky yarn and a 5mm hook.  
Remember to choose a hook small enough to make the head without there being too many gaps as it will be lightly stuffed.


## Materials
Yarn (I used aran weight cotton):
- brown (foxy) colour (~250m) 
- White < 20m
-  Black < 20m

Safety eyes (but you could use stitching or buttons) 

Hook (I used 4mm)

Embroidery needle


## Notes
US crochet terms used through

sc = single crochet

inc = increase

dec = invisible decrease

dc = double crochet

slst = slip stitch

R10 (dec, sc x 2) x 3 (9) = Row ten, decrease using invisible decrease, single crochet into the next two stitches. Repeat this process twice more. Result should be equal to nine sitches.
